# phoneNumberConvert
Converts phone numbers to something instantly paste-able in two different and somehow relevant forms.

To build from source:

1. Ensure python is installed
2. Ensure pyinstaller is installed (run pip pyinstaller in cmd once python is installed)
3. Open a cmd window and use "cd C:\...\..." to navigate to the path you've saved phoneNumberConvert.py
4. Run "pyinstaller phoneNumberConvert.py" within the cmd window and wait for a newline in the cmd window
5. Close cmd
6. Within the folder, you should now see the folders "build" and "dist" and the file "phoneNumberConvert.spec" in addition to the .py file that was there before. Navigate to dist\phoneNumberConvert and find phoneNumberConvert.exe
7. Move phoneNumberConvert.exe to wherever you'd like to run it
8. Delete all other files :D

To use as-is:

1. Download phoneNumberConvert.exe
2. Run it :D

The .py file was made with input from ChatGPT to avoid Googling how to put text into the Windows Clipboard.
